# What is it
This project is a lightweight screen recorder coded in Python. My goal with this is to make a screen recorder for Windows XP x32, as I have not found such a recorder myself.
# Creators
The project was started by Marcin Jacek Chmiel on March 15th, 2025.
# How to use
Once the app window opens, input file paths for file saving places like this:
C:\Users\User\Videos\videoname.mp4
C:\Users\User\Videos\audioname.wav
AND NOT:
"C:\Users\User\Videos\videoname.mp4"
"C:\Users\User\Videos\audioname.wav"
Press "Record" to start recording. Press "Stop" to stop recording, then press "Save" if you want to save the video files.
# Future additions
-combine audio and video together,
-recording start and end sounds,
-settings with "Save by default" setting,
-colored buttons,
-compile for Windows XP x32,
-compile for Windows XP x64,
-(maybe) other old Windows versions
