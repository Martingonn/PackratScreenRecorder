# What is it?
This project is a lightweight screen recorder coded in Python. My goal with this is to make a screen recorder for Windows XP x32, as I have not found such a recorder myself.
# Creators
The project was started by Marcin Jacek Chmiel on March 15th, 2025. Right now, there are no other contributors.
# How to use
Once the app window opens, input file paths for file saving places like this:
<br>C:\Users\User\Videos\videoname.mp4
<br>C:\Users\User\Videos\audioname.wav</br>
AND NOT:
<br>"C:\Users\User\Videos\videoname.mp4"
<br>"C:\Users\User\Videos\audioname.wav"</br>

Press "Record" to start recording. Press "Stop" to stop recording, then press "Save" if you want to save the video files.
# Future additions
<br>-combine audio and video together,
<br>-recording start and end sounds,
<br>-settings with "Save by default" setting,
<br>-colored buttons,
<br>-compile for Windows XP x32,
<br>-compile for Windows XP x64,
<br>-(maybe) compile for other old Windows versions,
<br>-more file output formats,
<br>-save path and file name seperately,
<br>-streaming,
<br>-for streaming: adding in background image and music (like "brb" screen),
<br>-add resolution choice (720p, 1080p, less...),
<br>-add way to record specific windows,
<br>-video recording preview before you press "record"
