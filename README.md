# What is it?
This project is a lightweight screen recorder coded in Python. My goal with this is to make a screen recorder for Windows XP x32, as I have not found such a recorder myself.
# Creators
The project was started by Marcin Jacek Chmiel on March 15th, 2025. Right now, there are no other contributors.
# How to use
Once the app window opens, input file paths for file saving places like this:
<br>C:\Users\User\Videos\videoname.mp4
<br>C:\Users\User\Videos\audioname.wav</br>
AND NOT:
<br>"C:\Users\User\Videos\videoname.mp4"
<br>"C:\Users\User\Videos\audioname.wav"</br>

Press "Record" to start recording. Press "Stop" to stop recording, then press "Save" if you want to save the video files.
# Future additions
-combine audio and video together,
-recording start and end sounds,
-settings with "Save by default" setting,
-colored buttons,
-compile for Windows XP x32,
-compile for Windows XP x64,
-(maybe) other old Windows versions,
-more file output formats,
-save path and file name seperately,
-streaming,
-for streaming: adding in background image and music (like "brb" screen)
